## Take the script for spin
In order to try out the functionality of the scripts and not perform the entire analysis line by line, please use the Preprocessing_example.mat file. It can be used with the file structure in the university cloud. You only might have to change the directories at the beginning of the script to include the folders I shared with you. No output is saved in this version.
