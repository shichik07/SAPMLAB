## Content
This repository contains all necessary scripts and links of the relevant data to perform a SVM analysis one Go/NoGo EEG task data.
The purpose of this project was the analysis of a Go/NoGo EEG data set via machine learning techniques. The data set used for this analysis is a subset of the publicly avaialable [data set] by Swart et al. 2018. For the analysis large proportions of the pre-processing scripts kindly provided by Swart et al. 2018, have been used and minorly adapted. Pre-processing was performed using the [Fieldtrip toolbox] (Oostenveld, Fries, Maris and Schoffelen 2011). 
All other analysis scripts are my own work. Note: relevant toolboxes and materials to be added.
