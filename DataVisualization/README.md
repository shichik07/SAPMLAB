## Data Visualization Script
Simple script to skim the data, have a look at the ERPs and see what kind of ERP differences are to be expected.

### Notes for the analysis of the behavioral data
The actual task consisted of a motivational Go/NoGo task. Hence there were multiple different types of Go and NoGo conditions. For the analysis that I am planning a distinction between these different categories is not very relevant. Moreover since I only use a subset of participants (5 out of a total of ~20), it is unlikely that given so little data we would be able to detect such fine distinction. Hence in this analysis we only care for:
1. Correctly answered trials
2. Go and NoGo trials
